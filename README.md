# CS120 #
This repository contains all of my notes on the course material covered in class. It contains notes, project code, and an outline of homework assignment #13 that is simpler and easier to read. 

If you have questions on a topic, see something you think is wrong, or know of a topic you would like to know more about, let me know and I will post something about it.

_**NOTE:**_ Although easy to find, you may not know about the online textbook. It covers nearly all the course material in a simple easy to understand way and has review questions by topic that you might be able to use for review. It can be found at [Rook's Guide to C++](https://rooksguide.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/rooks-guide-isbn-version.pdf).
