# Linked Lists
Constructed using pointers, and grows and shrinks during run time by adding or removing elements. Linked lists are dynamic data structures that use structures or classes to modify the amount of data stored.

Linked Lists are composed of nodes and each node is a variable of struct or class type that is dynamically allocated using the *new* operator. Nodes also contain pointers to the previous node (head), and next node (tail) for movement in the list.
