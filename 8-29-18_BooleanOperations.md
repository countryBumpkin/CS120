## Boolean Operations:
std::cin.ignore() ignores the input of the user up to the specified character if the space in the parenthesis is left blank, then the default is the next character in the buffer is
ignored



## Errors

Types:

	(1) Compiler Errors
		Occur at the compile time of the program. Catches some problems, but only if they pertain to syntax or data types.

	(2) Runtime Errors
		* divide by 0
		* try to access memory outside the program scope

	(3) Logical Errors
		* incorrect conditions
		* uninitialized variables
		* missing cases



## Debugging
* Be patient
* Read the whole error message
* Fix the first error message before moving onto the others
* Localize the error using std::cout statements
	- Check values of variables using std::cout statements
* Use comments to make code more easily understandable and check for logical errors
* Rubber Ducky Debugging
* Use a debugger(?)
